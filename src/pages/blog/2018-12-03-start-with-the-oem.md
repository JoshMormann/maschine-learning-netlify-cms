title: Start with the OEM

  OEM stands for Original Equipment Manufacturer. When it comes to learning how
  to use anything, if there is documentation from the producer or manufacturer,
  start there. Native Instruments has some of the best documentation and
  training of any software and hardware manufacturer, and to be unfamiliar with
  their products by means of their operators manuals would be a mistake.

The below statement isn't as true as NI would have you believe but it will get you pointed in the right direction:

> All available user manuals can be found in the Documentation folder within the application folder of your Native Instruments product:
>
> Mac: Applications > Native Instruments > \*product name\* > Documentation
>
> Windows: Program Files > Native Instruments > \*product name\* > Documentation

Because NI is always updating the software associated with their hardware, they have opted to not include the actual manuals in your app folder, in favor of providing a link to where the latest and greatest can be found. And that is here on their Maschine [downloads page](https://www.native-instruments.com/en/products/maschine/production-systems/maschine/downloads/).

Read it all. Download all their documentation for your version of Maschine, and get familiar with it. While many training avenues can be a lot of fluff or off target for your purposes, you can never go wrong by becoming familiar with the documentation from the OEM. That's not just true for Maschine, or any of NI's products, but for any product from any company.

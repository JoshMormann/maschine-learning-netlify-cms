  Learning anything online can be frustrating, but it can also be one of the
  most effective ways to learn anything, and stay up-to-date on whatever subject
  happens to be your focus. Native Instruments Maschine, as with all of the NI
  product line, or any other software or hardware these days is always being
  improved, which can improve your workflow if you are always willing to stay up
  to speed. We will not only be providing links to resources for self-training,
  but we will be offering reviews and recommendations.

As we start to build out our resources on Maschine Learning, our primary focus will be on recommending quality resources based on your skill level, and personal development goals. We will also be continually making efforts to find inspirational videos, and stories of artists and producers doing amazing things with Maschine in their workflows. 

While we will do our best to let you know what is out there, and whether or not investing your time or money in those resources might be worth it to you, all efforts to self-train are by their nature personal. We will do our best to protect you from wasting your time or money on resources that may not be applicable to you, but to truly gain any success through studying resources online, you will have to take ownership of your learning process the entire way. 

As the author of this blog, I have taught myself everything that I know in my career. I am a graphic designer, and UX consultant by trade, and because the tools, and platforms that I work in professionally, were changing rapidly at the time I was entering college (and are contenting to change), I decided to drop out of college, and enter the workforce early, so that I could start getting paid, and stay up to speed in the industry through self-training. I found that finding my own course work, and setting my own curriculum was a more efficient way to stay informed, and find work. I entered the work-force two years earlier than my college friends, and increased my salary steadily as well, by continuing to learn applicable new things in my field. 

The means I used to stay ahead of the curve were pretty simple. And I've narrowed my approach down to 5 simple things. 

## 1. Re-Renew your Passion.

Passion is a slippery subject. The advice to; 'do what you love,' is a difficult thing to undertake for most people. There are some people that seem to have singular and burning passions for certain subjects that are almost outside themselves and beyond their control, so this standard advice often comes from that lucky lot, and they don't understand how elusive, or fickle passion can be. Finding that passion is often the hardest part, but fortunately for us, the hardest part about pursuing one's passion is likely not going to be difficult in the context of this site. If you are reading this, you are likely either passionate about music, or beat making, or some aspect of producing, or performing music, but the second hardest part of pursuing one's passion, is that it can come and go. Passion is fickle for most of us humans, and I believe it's even more so now than ever before, because of the ever-changing world we live in. Not only do our lives change, in terms of relationships, and family, and other personal circumstances, which can diminish our focus, but we are constantly being bombarded with imagery of happy people doing things that make them happy, or rich, which can have the affect of causing you to question your direction all together. 

I don't entirely believe in the adage of 'fake it till you make it', but there is some wisdom there, what works for me, is to find ways to renew your passion, remake it, don't fake it. Take note of what inspires you to want to get to your lab and make sick beats, and use it. If it's listening to music that makes you want to make more music, turn it up. If it's watching performers play to a bumping crowd, keep some of those performances on tap, or go to those shows. If buying new gear gets you going, get some new gear (keep in mind that all these tricks can be a trap, as I'll explain later).  Whatever does the trick, keep those tricks up your sleeve, because you will either get frustrated, or you will slowly lose interest if you fail to consistently feed your passion for the craft. 

## 2. Practice on the Pain

There are entire books on the subject of Deliberate Practice (I will cite at the bottom). Deliberate practice is essentially the act of practicing the right things regularly, and methodically. The right things are the ones that will stack up to overall improvement. Just like passion, the 'right things' can be hard to pin down, if you don't know what to look for, but the concept is simple: if it's annoying, tedious, awkward or painful, it may be something you should be focusing on. In most art forms, the most difficult parts of the craft to grasp are what separate the dabblers from the masters. 

For example, to develop the muscle memory around the software and hardware devices in your studio, you will need to force yourself to practice what doesn't come naturally. In Maschine for example, a huge layer of functionality lives below the 'shift' button. Learn them all, practice them, until they become second nature, even if some of the aspects of your practice rarely have a use in your workflow. If you ever bump into something that's particularly difficult, make note of it, and make time to practice that part of the workflow until you can do it without thinking, and then come back to it if you haven't done it in a while. 

It may be difficult to see how a production tool is something needs to be practiced like an instrument, but to truly master anything, you need to practice the fundamentals of using it. You will never operate at top capacity if you have to Google everything every time. If you find yourself Googling anything a second time. Make sure you never have to Google it again. Drill it, till you own it, so that you never have to go back to your web browser. 

## 3. Read the Manual

'RTFM,' Was advice given me when I was back in high school, I don't even remember the circumstances, because while the phrase stuck with me, the circumstances were lost on me at the time because I didn't head the advice at the time. It wasn't until I was learning Adobe Illustrator years later that the advice settled in. Adobe Illustrator is an industry standard Vector Illustration application that is notorious for being difficult to use. While most tools in the Adobe Arsenal can be used effectively to a degree without much training, Illustrator in the early days had nearly half of all its controls hidden beneath key commands, and 'chords' of key commands. I never would have ever reached a professional level understanding of the application if I hadn't read the entire manual, as well as additional text books on the software. You may just want to learn by doing, and we'll get to that, learning by doing is essential, but you will miss out on a great deal of opportunity if you don't read the manual. Read it. You can set yourself apart from many so-called 'experts' in almost any pursuit by simply reading the manual. The Maschine is a tool, as well as every other device and software in your studio, get to know its documentation closely. At the very least you should become familiar with it to the point where it becomes a better reference than Google. Reading the release notes for new features is equally important. Don't ever be left behind. 

Back in the day ever piece of software worth the money you paid for it would ship with a printed manual that weighed at least a pound. I think we've lost a huge component of mastery with the advent of the PDF, having a dog eared copy of a manual flopped on your desk opened to a particular section is something I truly miss. If you are struggling with any aspect of your workflow, I recommend getting a copy of the manufacturers official document printed up and bound so you can have a physical copy on your desk to thumb through, and mark up. 

## 4. Go Deep Before You Go Wide

Since we're focused on the Maschine here, then where to go deep is a given, but this advice applies to any aspect of your studio or workflow. Sometimes in we can go too far in our efforts of stoking our passion and inadvertently spread ourselves too thin. We can buy too much gear or software, or sound packs, or listen to too many styles of music, and create too many options for our attention, and we can end up with '[Overchoice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overchoice)' or Choice overload. [Steve Jobs put it best](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6pTv_DJNfTg) when he said that  focusing is about saying, 'no', and my Grandfather had a great phrase to combat the addiction we can have to gear overload. "Use it up, wear it out, make it do, or do without." Usually a good indicator of someone's skill is how 'used' their gear is. We have a tendency to have an unhealthy reverence for new gear. Yes, you should keep it operational and not abuse anything, but if your shift button as been warn down to be unreadable, that's probably a good sign that you are going deep. Let the breadth of your understanding take care of itself as an ancillary function of going deep. Force yourself to try and get the most possible out of one piece of kit, before you add more. I like to remember that the Beatles had far less gear to produce some of the best selling records of all time. 

## 5. Join the Cult of Done

While a recent documentary on 3D printing has made Bre Pettis out to be a bit of a [source closing tool bag](https://www.netflix.com/title/80005444), he and Kio Stark are the co-authors of what I think to be the best advice toward mastery of anything. The Cult of Done Manifesto applies to creativity in all its forms. You cannot be creative unless you create. Nothing is truly created until it's done. The real advice here is to learn by doing. Passion, Practice, and Study are essential for mastery, but they will yield nothing for you or anyone else in the long run, if you don't create things. So in closing I give you the Cult of Done Manifesto...

**The Cult of Done Manifesto: **

1. There are three states of being. Not knowing, action and completion.
2. Accept that everything is a draft. It helps to get done.
3. There is no editing stage.
4. Pretending you know what you’re doing is almost the same as knowing what you
   are doing, so just accept that you know what you’re doing even if you don’t
   and do it.
5. Banish procrastination. If you wait more than a week to get an idea done, abandon it.
6. The point of being done is not to finish but to get other things done.
7. Once you’re done you can throw it away.
8. Laugh at perfection. It’s boring and keeps you from being done.
9. People without dirty hands are wrong. Doing something makes you right.
10. Failure counts as done. So do mistakes.
11. Destruction is a variant of done.
12. If you have an idea and publish it on the internet, that counts as a ghost of done.
13. Done is the engine of more.

If you have any desire to make money in the business of beat-making, do yourself a favor and [read NI's blog](https://blog.native-instruments.com/how-to-sell-your-beats-online) on the subject. Author Angus Paterson goes into some detail on the market places out there to help you sell your wares, preparation advice, as well as some of the legal hoops you'll need to jump through in order to keep your business safe in the licensing aspect of your beats. He also covers the most important parts of any business endeavor and they are marketing, and diligence. While there are new places popping up all the time to expand your business opportunities in digital music, there is no free ride. There never has been. While the movie Field of Dreams is a beautiful story, I think it infected the western world with the notion that your customers will come if you just put your work out there. The world is ultimately meritocracy, but often the merit of one's work will never get a vote without marketing and diligence. If you build it, they will _not_ come, unless you use whatever means necessary to let them know its there! Your marketing merit is on the line, hand in hand with your product, don't let anyone tell you otherwise.

First off there are dozens of training videos available from the manufacturer themselves; Native Instruments. But there are dozens of other training sites and youtube channels offering their own advice on this state-of-the-art music and beat machine.

As we begin to grow the site, we will begin to review the various training products out in the wild, from ebooks, to youtube videos and channels to paid training sites and resources. As we make sense of what's out there, we will pass the best of the best on to you. We will even keep our eyes and ears pealed for how the Maschine is incorporated into various workflows of artists and producers around the world.
